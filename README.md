#  JWT Auth Backend Project



# Validation Improvements in Backend
## Summary of Changes:
Added ValidationUtils class in the com.security.utils package to validate email format and password strength.

Used strong regular expressions for accurate validation of input data.

Performed validation in service or controller layers before processing requests.

Returned appropriate HTTP responses with error messages on validation failure (e.g., 400 Bad Request).

Utilized @Valid annotation on request DTOs and performed additional manual validation in controllers when necessary.




# User Profile Web Application - Phase 3: Manage Articles

## Project Overview
This project is a modern web application for managing user profiles, developed in multiple phases. **Phase 3** focuses on implementing the **Manage Articles** feature, enabling authenticated users to create, view, update, and delete articles within a dedicated Articles tab in their profile. This phase includes updates to the frontend, backend, and database, with all CRUD operations successfully implemented and tested.

## Features of Phase 3
- **Articles Tab in User Profile**: A dedicated tab in the user profile, accessible only to authenticated users.
- **CRUD Operations for Articles**:
    - **Create**: Users can create new articles with a title and rich text content.
    - **Read**: Display a list of the user's articles with details (title, content, creation date, and update date).
    - **Update**: Edit the title and content of existing articles.
    - **Delete**: Delete articles with user confirmation.
- **Rich Text Editor**: Utilizes Quill for creating and editing article content with formatting options (e.g., bold, italic, lists, links).
- **Authentication**: The Articles tab is accessible only to users authenticated via JWT.
- **Persistent Storage**: Articles are stored in a MySQL database.
- **User Interface**: Responsive design using Bootstrap with localized messages for better user experience.
- **Successful Testing**: All features (frontend, backend, and database) have been thoroughly tested and function without errors.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side and client-side rendering (using App Router).
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and scalable development.
- **Quill**: Rich text editor for creating and editing article content.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to backend APIs.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling the user interface.

### Backend
- **Spring Boot 3.5.3**: Java framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database management and CRUD operations.
- **Spring Security**: For JWT-based authentication.
- **Java 21**: Java version used for backend development.
- **MySQL Connector**: For connecting to the MySQL database.

### Database
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing articles with the `articles` table.
- **Articles Table Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE articles (
      id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
      title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      content TEXT NOT NULL,
      user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
      created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
      updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL
  );
  ```

## Implementation Details
### Frontend
- **Component: `ArticlesTab.tsx`**:
    - Located in the user profile page (`/profile`), accessible only to logged-in users.
    - Includes a form for creating/editing articles with title and content fields (using Quill).
    - Displays a list of user articles with edit and delete options.
    - Handles errors (e.g., unauthenticated access or API failures) with user-friendly messages.
    - Uses Axios for CRUD requests to backend APIs.
- **Component: `RichTextEditor.tsx`**:
    - A Quill-based rich text editor for article content.
    - Uses `next/dynamic` with `{ ssr: false }` to load Quill on the client side, avoiding SSR issues.
    - Supports text formatting (headers, bold, italic, lists, links, etc.).
    - Synchronizes editor content with parent component state for creating and editing articles.

### Backend
- **RESTful APIs**:
    - `POST /api/articles`: Create a new article.
    - `GET /api/articles`: Retrieve the user's articles.
    - `PUT /api/articles/{id}`: Update an existing article.
    - `DELETE /api/articles/{id}`: Delete an article.
- **Authentication**: All APIs are protected with JWT, ensuring only authenticated users can access them.
- **Transaction Management**: Uses `@Transactional` in `ArticleService` to ensure database changes are committed.
- **SQL Logging**: Enabled with `spring.jpa.show-sql=true` for debugging database queries.

### Database
- **Table: `articles`**: Designed to store articles with fields for `id`, `title`, `content`, `user_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
- **MySQL Connection**: Configured in `application.properties` for MySQL integration.
- **Validation**: Uses `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate` to ensure table compatibility with the Entity.

- **Java**: Version 21 for the backend.
- **MySQL**: Version 8 for the database.
- **Maven**: For managing backend dependencies.
- **NPM**: For managing frontend dependencies.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repositories**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miladrostami-devjava/fullstack-auth-phase3-backend
   git clone https://github.com/miladrostami-devjava/fullstack-auth-phase3-frontend-nextjs-Article-Tab-Improvements-project
   ```

2. **Install Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd fullstack-auth-phase3-frontend-nextjs-Article-Tab-Improvements-project
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Install Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd fullstack-auth-phase3-backend
   mvn install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   APIs are available at `http://localhost:9090`.

4. **Database Setup**:
    - Create a MySQL database (e.g., `myapp`):
      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE myapp;
      ```
    - Update `application.properties` in the backend:
      ```properties
      spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/myapp?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
      spring.datasource.username=your_username
      spring.datasource.password=your_password
      spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
      spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate
      spring.jpa.show-sql=true
      ```

5. **Create Articles Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE articles (
       id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       content TEXT NOT NULL,
       user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
       created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
       updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL
   );
   ```

6. **Testing**:
    - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/profile` and log in.
    - Access the Articles tab and test CRUD operations.

## Testing
- **Create Article**: Verified that articles with title and rich text content are saved in the database.
- **Read Articles**: User articles are displayed correctly in the Articles tab.
- **Update Article**: Changes to title and content are successfully saved.
- **Delete Article**: Articles are deleted with user confirmation.
- **Authentication**: Access to the Articles tab is restricted to authenticated users.
- **Database**: SQL queries logged and verified to ensure proper data storage.

## Resolved Issues
- **Quill Errors**:
    - Issue: Errors like `Class constructor Quill cannot be invoked without 'new'` and `quillRef.current.on is not a function`.
    - Solution: Used `next/dynamic` with `{ ssr: false }` to load Quill on the client side.
- **Database Storage**:
    - Issue: Articles not saving in MySQL.
    - Solution: Corrected `application.properties`, rebuilt the `articles` table, and added `@Transactional`.

## Maven Parent Overrides Note

Due to Mavenâ€™s design, some elements such as `<license>` and `<developers>` are inherited from the parent POM to your projectâ€™s POM.
In this project, these elements are overridden as empty to prevent unwanted inheritance.
If you switch to a different parent POM and want to inherit those elements, you will need to remove these empty overrides manually.
